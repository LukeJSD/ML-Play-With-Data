Chris Cathcart and Luke Julian, Human Beings, Group number 57

Background: We are both runners, pulling NCAA D2 cross country and track and field data

Problem: Figuring out how many all americans an athlete will attain given performances

Solution: KNN to classify different athletes to determine ALL American status

Results: pretty good, tested on team and others: Taylor Stack, Charlie Sweeney, Rodarte
Bix

Adjust our data if we need a certain feautre (elevation)

Outcome: build a solid model for predicting how many AA an athlete will attain in their
career 

Data: Luke 

Feature  Learning: Me

Model: Luke will start, Chris will end 

Evaluation: Validation scoring, bestK, f1 score, confusion matrix, classification report

Constraints: No elevation data, figuring what data to use, there multiple problems that 
we can solve so it's hard kinda chose between certain areas 

Project Expectations: 
We expect have a full working model with the machine learning the best features then using 
that to come up with a model for the data. 

Results: All American predictions: Luke 

Timelime: Making good progress based on initial report, data: longer figuring out what 
problem we want to solve, modeling: shorter than we thought (about the same) 

Update timelime: November 17th, figured out our best model to use 

Milestones: Coming up with a concrete problem, our model is best that it can be, 
good results, feature learning completed, model completion. 

Both work collectively on everything, share work across tasks

Data: Features: IDs, Time, Distance, avg, std, all americans, meet, year, place, 
Target: All americans 
66,000 rows of data from atheltes spanning from 2010 - present 

Model: 
KNN model bestK is 7, classifying the data into 7 separate categories 
Use confusion, classification report, and f1 score to determine scoring of the model 
Training data: 5165 data points 
Testing data: 2544 data points 
Total: 7709 data: People who competed at 2019 XC nationals
